# FianceCalculator

The primary goal of this project is to gain experience writing WPF applications. I also find myself budgeting money quite a bit and wanted an application that I could compile a bunch of fiancial formulas for quick and easy calculations.
The main focus of the project so far is around Loan and Morgage calculators.

Implemented Calculators:
  - Morgage Payment Calculator
  - Refiance Calculator
  
Future Ideas
  - Monthly Budget Planner
  - 401k Calculator
  - Early Loan packback plan
